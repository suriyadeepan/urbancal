> _This is your life, and it's ending one week at a time_

UrbanCal is a simple life calendar inspired by [Tim Urban's TED talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D1KVIuvjA) on procrastination. The features include 90 years Week/Month calendar, Task Scheduling, Reminder and Progress Tracking. It is built for procrastinators like me, to help complete everyday tasks and achieve life goals. It can also track the time you spend on Career, Life, Hobbies and time wasted away on Instant Gratification.
